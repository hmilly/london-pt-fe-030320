  <p>The cuisine of the United States is extremely diverse, owing to the vastness of the continent, the relatively large population (1/3 of a billion people) and the number of native and immigrant influences. 
    Mainstream American culinary arts are similar to those in other Western countries. Wheat and corn are the primary cereal grains. Traditional American cuisine uses ingredients such as turkey, potatoes, sweet potatoes, 
    corn (maize), squash, and maple syrup, indigenous foods employed by American Indians and early European settlers, African slaves and their descendants.

  <br>
  <p>The types of food served at home vary greatly and depend upon the region of the country and the family's own cultural heritage. 
    Recent immigrants tend to eat food similar to that of their country of origin, and Americanized versions of these cultural foods, 
    such as American Chinese cuisine or Italian-American cuisine often eventually appear. Vietnamese cuisine, Korean cuisine and Thai 
    cuisine in authentic forms are often readily available in large cities. German cuisine has a profound impact on American cuisine, 
    especially mid-western cuisine; potatoes, noodles, roasts, stews, cakes, and other pastries are the most iconic ingredients in both cuisines.
     Dishes such as the hamburger, pot roast, baked ham, and hot dogs are examples of American dishes derived from German cuisine.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Different regions of the United States have their own cuisine and styles of cooking. 
    The states of Louisiana and Mississippi, for example, is known for their Cajun and Creole cooking.
    Cajun and Creole cooking are influenced by French, Acadian, and Haitian cooking, although the dishes
    themselves are original and unique. Examples include Crawfish Etouffee, Red Beans and Rice, Seafood or
    Chicken Gumbo, Jambalaya, and Boudin. Italian, German, Hungarian and Chinese influences, traditional Native 
    American, Caribbean, Mexican and Greek dishes have also diffused into the general American repertoire.
    It is not uncommon for a "middle-class" family from "middle America" to eat, for example, restaurant pizza, 
    home-made pizza, enchiladas con carne, chicken paprikas, beef stroganof and bratwurst with sauerkraut for dinner 
    throughout a single week.</p>
