        English afternoon tea or simply afternoon tea is a traditional blend of
        teas originating from India, China, Africa and Sri Lanka. Afternoon tea
        blends are often lighter than breakfast blends, being designed to
        "complement, rather than mask the flavor of the afternoon tea meal".

        The meal which comes with afternoon tea often consists of light
        sandwiches, pastries, biscuits, muffins, scones or cookies, and cake as
        well as mixed fruits depending on the season. During summer, iced tea
        and light fruit cups were popular. In winter, spiced tea and warm
        punches are commonly served. The tea that accompanies the meal is
        described as a lighter medium bodied, bright black tea or other type of
        tea. Strong Assam and Kenyan teas are blended with Ceylon which adds a
        light, brisk quality to the blend.
